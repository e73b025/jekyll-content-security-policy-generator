# jekyll-content-security-policy-generator Plugin

This Jekyll plugin automatically builds an HTML content-security-policy for a Jekyll site. The plugin
will scan ```.html``` files generated by Jekyll and attempt to locate images, styles, scripts, frames etc and build a
content security policy HTML meta tag. The script will also generate SHA256 hashes for inline scripts and styles. If
the script finds elements with style attributes ```<div style="color: red"></div>```, the script will extract the style
information and build a style element to which will also pass through the content security policy generation.

## Goal

To speed up development of Jekyll based sites whilst also helping to generate secure HTMl files protected from XSS.

## Features

* Scans for ```.html``` files generated by Jekyll.
* Finds inline scripts such as ```<script>alert("Hello World!");</script>``` and generates an SHA256 hash.
* Finds inline styles such as ```<style>.hello { color: "red"; }</style>``` and generates an SHA256 hash.
* Creates or reuses an HTTP meta tag for the content security policy.
* Finds all images, styles, scripts and frames with external URLs and builds CSP.
* Converts style attributes into ```<style>``` elements.
